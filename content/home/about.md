# Biography
NOTE: THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

Much of the content currently on this page is left over from template values.
Anything that says "GA Cushen" or "MS Nixon" is obviously not by Alex Guerra.
(So far only this section has been updated, but more updates to come soon)

TODO: Write a biography :)
