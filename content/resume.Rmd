## Objective
I want to find a way to combine my fascination with system-scale processes with large-scale data analysis in order to elucidate and examine patterns in natural systems. I have a deep interest in ecological dynamics, environmental change, and in combining my interest in data analysis and programming with the study of ecological problems in order to model Ecological systems based on collected data. I constantly seek to expand my skills, pursue my interests, and eternally seek a more precise understanding of how natural systems work and can be quantified.

# Accomplishments

## Personal

- Acquired my Bachelors degree after 3.5 years of study
- Obtained a certificate in front-end Web design after 1 year of study, and working on getting a certification on Back-End Web Design as well
- Used knowledge attained of web-design principles to set up, configure, and build pages for my own home server where I showcase examples of my work at http://apgplanner.com
- Learned image, video, and sound editing from taking classses
- Taught myself Actionscript 2.0 and 3.0 in order to make a couple of simple Flash games.
- Obtained a CPR card and EMT-Basic certification in the summer of 2010

## Academic

- Spent a lot of time volunteering and working in various labs as a lab assistant. Worked in a diverse range of settings: Cancer research, ecological analyses of of invertebrate recruitment numbers, limnological equipment assembly, data wrangling, and data visualization.
- Processed data for Arctic LTER Toolik Lake Primary Productivity, Inorganic Matter, and Organic Matter datasets in Excel, which involved collecting 50 years of data from 50 individual files, all with different formats and varying in metrics tracked. Methodically standardized their formats, then combined them into a single, uniform 40,000 row table, all manually in Excel.
- Since processing the Arctic LTER data I have learned to catalog metadata on files and utilize that metadata in order to organize the approach to data processing and analysis. I learned the use of XML as well as database-oriented approaches to data tracking and hosting.
- Took a number of classes at UCSB that approximated ecological research experience, (specifically the EEMB 142 series) including studying ecological systems and processes, then learning about specific lab and field techniques, then going into the field to set up experiments, then at a later time collecting the experiments, processing samples in the lab, collecting data from the experiments, then performing statistical analysis on the numbers to evaluate whether the analysis of variance was “significant”, generating graphs to illustrate the data, and writing full-length papers in the style of journal articles, or even presenting the results to our classmates. These classes focused on the water systems of Santa Barbara and Goleta.
- Took a handful of classes similar to the above under Raymond Wells at Pierce College with a lot of the same approach and process, except in  San Pedro, CA, Ensanada,  Baja California, and Bahia de Los Angeles, Baja California on day trips, weekend trips, or one full two week long immersive research experience. Kept research notebooks, attended daily lectures, designed and executed field experiments, and wrote papers. I passed every field, lab, and lecture class offered, with the exception of the Oceanography classes. 
- More specific info can be found here: http://pcmsusa.org/marbio2.html
- Was told in passing by Dr Wells that my understanding of Aquatic Biology/Ecology was at the level of a Masters student.
- Currently scheduled to act as a TA on Dr Wells’ 2015 2-week summer class

## Professional

- Used video production/editing skills to self-produce a series of screencaptured video-tutorials in order to enhance the company’s new-hire trianing program using Camtasia.
- Later recruited and managed an internal team to take over video production.
- Taught myself R when it was requested of me by my previous employer and managed to improve upon an existing application.
- Taught myself SAS for another employer, and went as far as getting officially certified in Base SAS.
- Helped improve and expand company SAS code to be more broadly useful as well as more efficient.
- Created a large library of Linux commandline scripts that automate a large degree of data wrangling tasks, such as using regular expressions to remove invisible characters, automate repeated steps in my workflow, analyze data content and contextually clean up data based on the column type detected. Such scripts automated a huge percentage of my day-to-day workflow.
- Assessed my department’s current workflow processes and abstracted them enough to generalize the steps involved, then put together an algorithm description to demonstrate the current steps in process along with my own intuitively-designed approach. Demonstrated the efficacy of the changes needed and illustrated work savings involved in adopting my proposed workflow changes. Revolutionized our approach to data processing.
- Spearheaded an initiative to document current processes, methods for solving generalized problems, and “tips and tricks” for various applications, languages, and problem types.
- Created custom intranet web-application to track metadata on undocumented code, including explanatory information, usage information, specific dependencies between scripts, and managed workload with one other programmer.
- Made numerous software and configuration suggestions to our Linux administrator and frequently did research to find new existing programs that could solve current workflow problems in order to expedite workflow and increase automation.
- Suggested and provided support for the set up of an intranet Wiki based on MediaWiki within which I created a number of step-by step text  and image tutorials for how to use Linux as well as a number of other topics. These tutorials helped train some team members.
- Successfully trained/tutored several new employees in order to bring them up to speed, develop technical skills, and pass certification exams.
